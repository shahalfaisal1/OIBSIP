# Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as brand, fuel type, mileage, engine size, and other factors. By building a machine learning model, we can estimate the price of a car given its specifications, which can be useful for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is called "CarPrice.csv". It contains information about used cars, including their specifications and prices. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **CarName**: The name of the car.
- **brand**: The brand of the car extracted from the CarName column.
- **fueltype**: The type of fuel used by the car (gas or diesel).
- **doornumber**: The number of doors on the car (two or four).
- **mileage**: The mileage of the car (in kilometers per liter).
- **enginesize**: The size of the car's engine (in cubic centimeters).
- **price**: The price of the car (in the respective currency).

## Methodology

The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Exploration and Analysis: This step involves exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and performing statistical analysis to gain insights into the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: In this step, the data is cleaned and prepared for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. Feature Selection: The most relevant features are selected based on their importance and correlation with the target variable.

4. Model Building: A machine learning model is built using the preprocessed data. Various regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression can be considered.

5. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared value. Cross-validation techniques can also be applied to assess the model's generalizability.

6. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new data or integrated into a larger application or system.
