## Oasis Infobyte SIP Task 2 (Data Science) - Data Analysis of Unemployment in India during COVID-19

This repository contains the code and analysis for the data science project on analyzing the unemployment rate in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims to explore and understand the impact of the pandemic on employment across different states in India.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the "Unemployment in India" dataset, which provides information on the estimated unemployment rate, estimated employed individuals, and estimated labor participation rate. The dataset includes data for various states, regions, and time periods from October 2019 to May 2020.

## Project Steps

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - The dataset is imported using pandas library, and missing values are dropped.
   - Column names are updated to provide clearer information about the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizations are created to analyze the unemployment rate trends over time and across different states.
   - A sunburst chart is generated to showcase the unemployment rate in each state and region.

3. Analysis Before and After the Lockdown:
   - The dataset is divided into two periods: before the lockdown and after the lockdown.
   - The average unemployment rate is calculated for each state before and after the lockdown.
   - A percentage change in the unemployment rate is calculated to analyze the impact of the lockdown on employment.
   - States are categorized based on the impact of the lockdown on their unemployment rates.

4. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Various visualizations, including bar charts, are created to represent the findings and insights from the analysis.
   - The impact of the lockdown on employment across different states is visualized.

## Results and Conclusion

The analysis of the unemployment rate in India during COVID-19 reveals significant impacts on employment. Key findings include:

- Visualizations show the unemployment rate trends over time and differences across states and regions.
- The impact of the lockdown on employment varies across states, with some states experiencing a higher rate of unemployment compared to others.
- The percentage change in the unemployment rate after the lockdown provides insights into the severity of the impact on each state.
- States are categorized based on the impact of the lockdown on their unemployment rates, providing a clear understanding of the most affected regions.

This project provides valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment in India. The analysis can help policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding employment and economic recovery.
