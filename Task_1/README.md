## Oasis Infobyte SIP Task 1 (Data Science) - Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their measurements. The classification is performed using the scikit-learn library and a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Iris Flower

Iris flowers are characterized by their species, which include setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species are differentiated based on their measurements.

## Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project consists of 150 samples, each corresponding to one Iris flower. Each sample has four columns representing different measurements: sepal length, sepal range, petal length, and petal range.

## Classification Approach

The classification of Iris flowers into species is achieved using the scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library in Python. Specifically, a Decision Tree Classifier is employed to train a model on the Iris dataset.

## Model Accuracy

The accuracy of the trained model is reported to be approximately 97%. This indicates that the model is able to successfully classify Iris flowers with a high degree of accuracy.

## Results

The classification results obtained from the trained model are as follows:
- Setosa: 50 samples correctly classified
- Versicolor: 48 samples correctly classified
- Virginica: 49 samples correctly classified
